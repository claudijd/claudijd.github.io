After 6+ years at Mozilla, this week will be my last.

It's been a humbling experience and has been far from an easy journey, but I wouldn't trade this experience for anything.

What I'll miss the most is the people. Mozilla has this ability to attract a certain caliber of talent that I've just not seen replicated anywhere else.  There's just this underdog spirit and ability for folks to punch far above their weight that continues to inspire me to do more and be more.

Here's a few bright spots from my tenure:

- Being a member of a security team where there were more women than men (twice!)
- Building out an offensive security portfolio from scratch and testing some of the coolest targets I've seen in my career
- Forming new teams and watching them scale up to bring immense value
- Working for multiple bosses (and even non-bosses) whom I truly respect and made large investments in me
- Getting to work closely with individuals who have had and continue to have a large positive impact on the internet
- Traveling around the world and getting to explore new cultures with my coworkers and now friends
- The compassion of my coworkers while I suffered through multiple personal tragedies
- Working with multiple product teams to define and execute on security visions for their products
- The ability to not wear pants in meetings, and no one is the wiser ;)
- Being able to constructively challenge leadership, and it not being a career limiting move
- Learning how to work through complex situations that put equally important equities in direct tension
- Getting my first mohawk with a few folks on my team, including my boss!
- Understanding the compounding value of leaning in on strategy and planning over reactive posture
- Continuing to improve my ability to channel Steven Covey 7-habits training and strive for win-win outcomes
- Getting to renovate 2 houses step by step and share all in #diy
- Learning how to cope with being reorg'd, shuffled and resorted more times than I can count! (arewereorgedyet?)
- Getting to fight some real life bad guys and stop bad things from happening (many times!)
- Partnering with a legal and policy team who embodies the Mozilla mission and leads with a deep well of empathy and skill
- Being able to flip the laundry and load the dish washer on my lunch breaks
- Getting a formal education on how to work remote and in the open
- Internalizing the benefits of working within a diverse and inclusive environment at my core


Thank you and farewell!
